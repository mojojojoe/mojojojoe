- 👋 Hi, I’m @mojojojoe
- 👀 I’m interested in Python programming and algorithms, as well as machine learning.  I consider myself an excellent problem solver in the Linux domain.
- 🌱 I’m preparing for the RHCSA certification. I have a science degree from the University of South Africa. 
- 💞️ I like working in a team as this helps in the problem solving process as the collective mind is more powerful, although, for practical reasons I need to work remotely.
