- 👋 Hi, I’m @mojojojoe
- I am a research editor at Enago. I edit research manuscripts written by Chinese, Japanese and South Korean academics for journal publication.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python programming and algorithms. I would like to write code for a living and I am working toward that.  
- 🌱 I’m currently studying the CM2 course on financial engineering that is offered by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in the UK. I have a science degree from the University of South Africa. My goal is to become a quantitative analyst, programming in Python and C.
- 💞️ Does anyone want to employ me as a Python developer? I am slowly building up a repository of myCodeExamples. Please check it out to see which level I am at.
- I like working in a team as I learn more and the others help me to drive through problems. Often a workmate will provide an insight that is the catalyst to the problem's solution rather than getting stuck. However, circumstances dictate that my work be remote.
- 📫 Please email me at bruce.graham@gmail.com
