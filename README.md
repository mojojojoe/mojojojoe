- 👋 Hi, I’m @mojojojoe
- 👀 I’m interested in Python programming and algorithms, as well as machine learning.  
- 🌱 I’m currently working on an RHCSA certification. I have a science degree from the University of South Africa. 
- 💞️ I like working in a team as this helps in the problem solving process as the collective mind is more powerful. Often a workmate will provide an insight that is the catalyst to the problem's solution rather than one getting stuck.
