- 👋 Hi, I’m @mojojojoe
- 👀 I’m interested in finance and programming and operational research algorithms. I am capable of coding in Python, R and Julia. My C is a bit rusty.  
- 🌱 I’m currently studying the CM2 course on financial engineering that is offered by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in the UK. I have a science degree from the university of South Africa.
- 💞️ I want to collaborate with anyone who will offer me compensation for my time. Although I would like to find a challenge that would take my skills from great to brilliant.
- 📫 Please email me through wilbur dot boson at pm dot me or WhatsApp me on 00 27 68 665 82 47. I also use Keybase where my username is @mojojojoe
