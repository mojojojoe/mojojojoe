- 👋 Hi, I’m @mojojojoe
- I am a learning specialist at EdX working in the bootcamps. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Python programming and algorithms, as well as machine learning.  
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for the FRM certification. I have a science degree from the University of South Africa. My goal is to become a quantitative analyst, programming in Python and C.
- 💞️ I like working in a team as I learn more and the others help me to drive through problems. Often a workmate will provide an insight that is the catalyst to the problem's solution rather than getting stuck. However, circumstances dictate that my work be remote.
- 📫 Please email me at bruce.graham@gmail.com
