- 👋 Hi, I’m @mojojojoe
- I am a research editor at Enago. I edit research manuscripts written by Chinese, Japanese and South Korean academics for journal publication.
- 👀 I’m interested in finance and programming and operational research algorithms. I would like to write about DeFi topics and finance in general.  
- 🌱 I’m currently studying the CM2 course on financial engineering that is offered by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in the UK. I have a science degree from the University of South Africa.
- 💞️ I want to collaborate with anyone who will offer me compensation for my time. Although I would like to find a challenge that would take my skills from great to brilliant.
- 📫 Please email me through bruceg72@pm.me or WhatsApp me on 00 27 68 665 82 47. I also use Keybase where my username is @mojojojoe
