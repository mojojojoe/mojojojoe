__Summary__

Bruce has lived and breathed Linux since 1995. He has spent thousands of hours installing and configuring Linux systems. He has knowledge of Ansible, has tinkered with the Linux and FreeBSD kernels, and has embarked on many Linux projects over the years where he worked alone with the resources he had. It was during these efforts that Bruce became a powerful problem solver. He could be a good fit to the role.
